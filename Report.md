# Keypoints

The bank wants to improve their understanding of customers and seek specific actions to improve services.
Therefore it is looking for an instrument that evaluates the risk of non-payment of loans by clients.

## BU: analysis of requirements with the end user
- exploratory data analysis of the available data.
- instrument that predicts whether a loan will end successfuly or not.

> Confirmar / perguntar:
-  acerca do "To test a data mining approach to help the bank managers, it was decided to address two problems, a descriptive and a predictive one. While the descriptive problem was left open, the predictive problem is the prediction of whether a loan will end successfuly." A que é que se refere o 'descriptive problem' que foi deixado em aberto?

## BU: definition of business goals
By minimizing the risk of lending money to clients that are likely not to fulfill their obligations the bank will:
- minimize expected losses related to default credit.
- increase efficiency in the loan application process, improving service.
- due to a separation between a 'good' and 'bad' client, allow better loan conditions to 'good' clients (lower spread, for example), increasing client retention and capture from other banks.
- quantificação: 'threshold' -> reduzir em 20% o credito mal parado por exemplo

## BU: translation of business goals into data mining goals
By using account, client, disposition, transaction, loan, credit card and demographic data about known loan outcomes (client in debt or not):
- uncover trends and patterns that can differentiate a 'good' client from a 'bad' one.
- generate a model that can predict with a certain reliability a loan end result.
